The [CADC](https://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/en/) node of CANFAR is located at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victora and is part of the National Research Council of Canada. CADC provides scientific direction, operations support, and development support to the CANFAR platform. A primary function is supporting users of the the CANFAR platform where CADC is the first point of contact for Issue Tracking and resolution.



### CANFAR current activities

The CADC is active in nearly all areas of CANFAR:


* Operations
* Software Development
* Science
* User Support
* Management
* CANFAR proposal development

### Data & software needs and future plans

* **The C3TP project (CANFAR-CADC-DRAC Project)**

The CADC is currently (2015-2018) engaged in a $2.5 million co-development project with Digital Research Alliance Canada to develop and deploy CANFAR services on Digital Research Alliance Canada and to shift major operational responsibilities from CADC to Digital Research Alliance Canada. Half of the budget is being spent within CADC and half is directed to Digital Research Alliance Canada through a contract to develop services that will support CANFAR. The delivery of those services to the astronomy community will continue to be done through the Compute _Canada Resource Allocation process_.
